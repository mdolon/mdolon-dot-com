<h4 class="subtitle"><em>WeeklyCheckins</em> is an accountability tool that lets you track goals and check in with someone (via Zoom) every week.</h4>

<h4>How it works:</h4>
Go to <a href='https://weeklycheckins.com/'>WeeklyCheckins.com</a> and create an account. You'll see a week-by-week view of the year, with the current week highlighted with a red arrow. From this page, you can:

1. Add goals (I suggest 3-4 max)
2. Invite a friend to check-in with you
3. Once your friend confirms a time, you'll both receive a calendar invite with a Zoom link
4. Join the meeting at the scheduled time and discuss your goals for the week

I'm still adding functionality, including the ability to capture feedback during/after the check-in itself. If you have other feature requests or ideas, feel free to <a href="mailto:mdolon@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a>.

<h4>Why I created this:</h4>

  title="Set Goals" %}
I've been doing regular weekly check-ins with my friend Frankie for the past couple of months and it's been super helpful. Having a consistent check-in
partner that I respect, is also working on a startup and is very metric-driven has made me:
- Better quantify the work I do, which makes it easier to track progress
- Set more ambitious goals (I can't put in 50% effort if I see him constantly putting in more)
- Made me <em>feel</em> better about the entrepreneurial journey

I decided early on that setting goals on a weekly basis provides a good cadence for check-ins and keeps goals small but not too granular.

<h4>Try it out!</h4>

<a href='https://weeklycheckins.com/'>WeeklyCheckins</a> is live and mostly functional. Try it out and let me know what you think!
