<h4 class="subtitle"><em>ShopSuey</em> is a browser extension that hides sponsored products, reformats the page, and makes shopping online  way better.</h4>

You can install *ShopSuey* on Chrome or FireFox:

<div class="download-buttons">
  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopsuey-better-online-sh/epkdmppogcepckfgkbcphhagiiieafjk" class="button download-button">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/chrome.png" alt="Chrome"/>
    <strong>Install on Chrome</strong>
    <span>ShopSuey v1.0</span>
  </a>
  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shopsuey/" class="button download-button">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/firefox.png" alt="Firefox"/>
    <strong>Install on Firefox</strong>
    <span>ShopSuey v1.0</span>
  </a>
</div>

#### Here's how it works on Amazon.com

<div class="compare-images">
  <p>On a typical search for 'Whey Protein,' we see the following with and without ShopSuey.</p>
  <div class="before">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/amazon-before.png" alt="Before ShopSuey"/>
    <em>Without ShopSuey</em>
  </div>
  <div class="after">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/amazon-after.png" alt="After ShopSuey"/>
    <em>With ShopSuey</em>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="spacer" />

#### And on Ebay.com

<div class="compare-images">
  <p>
    When you search for 'iPhone X' on Ebay, you're usually shown a ton of sponsored products (red).
    ShopSuey chops those ads away.
  </p>
  <div class="before">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ebay-before.png" alt="Before ShopSuey"/>
    <em>Without ShopSuey</em>
  </div>
  <div class="after">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ebay-after.png" alt="After ShopSuey"/>
    <em>With ShopSuey</em>
  </div>
</div>


Currently, the extension only supports Amazon.com and Ebay.com but we're working on cleaning up
several other online retailers, including BestBuy, Target, and Walmart.

#### Frequently Asked Questions:

**Does this extension record any of my data?** <br />
Absolutely not. All of the code for the extension is contained on your machine after you install it --
there is no data sent to our servers at all. The permissions requested when installing ShopSuey
are required to be able to modify the actual sites themselves.

**Does this cost any money to use?** <br />
Nope, ShopSuey is completely free to download and use.

**How do you make money then?** <br />
We may show you price comparison options when you're on an actual product page (only if the
competitors are cheaper, of course). In the event we do, we'll use our affiliate code on the link.

**Isn't this just a glorified userscript?** <br />
Yes, it is.

**Is the code open source?** <br />
Not really. When you download the extension, you get minified version of the full codebase.
But it's not a public repo on Github or elsewhere and lacks documentation. I may get to this
in the near future if people are interested.
