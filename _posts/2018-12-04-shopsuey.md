<h4 class="subtitle"><em>ShopSuey</em> is a browser extension that hides sponsored products, reformats the page, and makes the overall online shopping experience way better.</h4>

You can install *ShopSuey* on Chrome or FireFox:

<div class="download-buttons">
  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopsuey-better-online-sh/epkdmppogcepckfgkbcphhagiiieafjk" class="button download-button">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/chrome.png" alt="Chrome"/>
    <strong>Install on Chrome</strong>
    <span>ShopSuey v1.0.3</span>
  </a>
  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shopsuey/" class="button download-button">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/firefox.png" alt="Firefox"/>
    <strong>Install on Firefox</strong>
    <span>ShopSuey v1.0.3</span>
  </a>
</div>

#### Here's how it works on Amazon.com

<div class="compare-images">
  <p>On a typical search for 'Whey Protein,' we see the following with and without ShopSuey.</p>
  <div class="before">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/amazon-before.png" alt="Before ShopSuey"/>
    <em>Without ShopSuey</em>
  </div>
  <div class="after">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/amazon-after.png" alt="After ShopSuey"/>
    <em>With ShopSuey</em>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="spacer" />

#### And on Ebay.com

<div class="compare-images">
  <p>
    When you search for 'iPhone X' on Ebay, you're usually shown a ton of sponsored products (red).
    ShopSuey chops those ads away.
  </p>
  <div class="before">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ebay-before.png" alt="Before ShopSuey"/>
    <em>Without ShopSuey</em>
  </div>
  <div class="after">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/ebay-after.png" alt="After ShopSuey"/>
    <em>With ShopSuey</em>
  </div>
</div>


Currently, the extension only supports Amazon.com and Ebay.com but we're working on cleaning up
several other online retailers, including BestBuy, Target, and Walmart.

#### Frequently Asked Questions:

**Does this extension record any of my data?** <br />
Absolutely not. Check the permissions when you install the extension, you never grant any
permissions like that. In fact, there are no external calls at all.

**Does this cost any money to use?** <br />
Nope, ShopSuey is completely free to download and use.

**How do you make money then?** <br />
When you install this extension, we may add our affiliate code to some products displayed
on the page. This **does not** impact your shopping experience. For qualified purchases made
with our affiliate code, we get a small fraction of the sale. There is no cost to you and all
of this happens behind-the-scenes. You can also disable this feature from the menu if you'd like.

We may also show you price comparison options when you're on an actual product page (only if the
competitors are cheaper, of course). In the event we do, we'll use our affiliate code there as well.

**Isn't this just a glorified userscript?** <br />
Yes, it is.

**Is the code open source?** <br />
Not really. When you download the extension, you get minified version of the full codebase.
But it's not a public repo on Github or elsewhere and lacks documentation. I may get to this
in the near future if people are interested.
