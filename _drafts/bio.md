I live in New York City and work at [UserTesting][0] as a software engineer.
Previously, I worked at a number of startups in San Francisco.
I'm passionate about education, healthcare, and the on-demand (gig) economy.

When I'm not working, you'll find me reading, playing guitar, running, surfing,
snowboarding, or generally spending time outside of the house.

The best way to get in touch with me is via email: mdolon+com@gmail.com
