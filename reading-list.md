I'm a firm believer that reading (and education, more broadly) has the most
profound and lasting impact in advancing human civilization. While my book list
is not nearly as comprehensive as others, I thought it may be interesting
to share what I have on my shelf.

I've purchased the following books over the last few years. I've read most
of these, and several are classics from high school that I occasionally like
to reread.
